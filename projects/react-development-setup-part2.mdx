# Painless development setup for React Part 2: Linting & Formatting

![Cover](/images/react-development-setup-part2/cover.png)

In the [previous blog](https://www.ypcethan.com/blog/react-development-setup-part1) we've setup a basic React development environment using Parcel. Parcel enables us to write modern Javascript and JSX with having the manually setup transpiler like Babel, it also provides a development server with hot reloading and hot module replacement if we only change the CSS this drastically improve the development experience.

In the this most we will build on top from the setup we had previously configure linter and code.

### Code formatting with Prettier

Code formatting is essential for teams that want to maintain a codebase with a consistent style. These code style choices might include whether or not to use the semicolon (given that it is optional in Javascript), single quote vs double quote for strings etc. Most of these decisions have little influence on the logic of the code and are based on stylistic preference and thus can be pretty subjective. It's not difficult to imagine how tedious it is to manually add a semicolon to each statement's end. Fortunately, we have code formatting tools like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which enable us to configure our preference in the JSON file, and it will do the heavy lifting to format the code for us.

Let's install Prettier as a dev dependency

```shell
npm i -D prettier
```

Create a Prettier config file that allows us to specify our stylistic preferences.

`.prettierrc`

```json
{
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

Here I configure Prettier to format our code to use a single quote instead of the double quote when possible and omit the semicolon. Prettiter offers a lot of [options](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html), you can have a look there.

To run Prettier againt all our Javascript and JSX files lets setup a npm script.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel",
    "build": "parcel build",
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js, jsx}\""
  },
```

Here we use a _glob_ to format all files recursively in the `src` ending with either `js` or `jsx`. You can refer to [here](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#pattern-syntax) for more about pattern matching.

### Linting with ESLint

Now we have configured our formatter, it's time to set up a linter.
In contrast to a formatter, which takes care of stylistic problems, a linter is more about code quality. It ensures our code follows certain best practices, for example, not declaring variables that aren't used, using `let` or `const` rather than `var` etc.

Install ESlint as a dev dependency.

```shell
npm i -D eslint
```

First, create an ESLint config file `.eslintrc.json` with an empty object.

```json
{}
```

To see how ESlint can help, let's create a Javascript file with a bunch of bad code.

`src/badcode.js`

```javascript
var a = 'asdf'
var b = 'qwer'
const c = '123'

if (1) {
  console.log('Hello')
}

function f() {
  b = 123
}

f()
```

To run ESLint against our bad code, let's run `npx src/badcode.js`

The result is _nothing_. No warning or error message.
![ESLint no response](/images/react-development-setup-part2/ESLint-no-response.png)
Even though to have installed ESlint, we have not told ESlint what [linting rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) we want to use.
By default, no rules apply.

Let's configure ESLint to check for unsed variables.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "error"
  }
}
```

![Linting error](/images/react-development-setup-part2/linting-error.png)
Now ESLint is shouting at us that our code violates the `no-unsed-vars` we defined in the config file.

The number of rules can be overwhelming and impractical to configure it one by one. Fortunately, there are many pre-existing configurations presets for us to use directly, `eslint:recommended` is one of them and provides a good starting point.

To use `eslint:recommended`, we specify it using the `extends` key.

https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs

`.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "extends": "eslint:recommended"
}
```

Let execute ESlint to check our `src/badcode.js` again.

Notice that despite the errors for unused variables, it also reports other errors. Extending `eslint:recommended` automatically enables a bunch of rules.

Side note:
If you are using VSCode, I recommend installing [ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). Once you enable the extension, there will be a red squiggly line underneath the parts that violates the rules.

![VSCode ESLint error](/images/react-development-setup-part2/vscode-eslint-error.png)

Tip:
If you prefer not to be distracted by the pop-up menu when you hover, you can disable the default setting by opening the `setting.json` file.
![Tip: Open VSCode settings](/images/react-development-setup-part2/open-vscode-settings.png)

```json
{
    ...
    "editor.hover.enabled": false,
}
```

And map your key preferred key binding to trigger the pop-up.
![Tip: Open VSCode keybinding settings](/images/react-development-setup-part2/open-vscode-keybinding-settings.png)
`keybindings.json`

```json
    {
        "key": "shift+k", // Your preferred key binding.
        "command": "editor.action.showHover",
        "when": "editorTextFocus"
    },
```

### Specifying environment and `parserOptions`

One thing that might surprise you is that ESLint complains about `console` not existing.
![console not found](/images/react-development-setup-part2/console-not-found.png)

ESLint does not have any assumption on the environment your code is running in and thus does not know what global variables shall be available.
Since our code will be running in the browser, let's tell ESLint.

```json
{
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "env": {
    "browser": true
  }
}
```

Now the error is gone.
![Error fiexed](/images/react-development-setup-part2/fix-error.png)

https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-environments

Now suppose are want to use syntax in modern JS like `const` and `let`.

The editor shows **Parsing error**.
![Parser error](/images/react-development-setup-part2/eslint-parser-error.png)
And instead of giving as linting error it actually break.
![ESLint break](/images/react-development-setup-part2/eslint-break.png)
This is because ESLint cannot parse our code. By default, ESLint expects ES5 syntax. And `let` and `const` are part of the ES6 syntax.
https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/language-options#specifying-parser-options

To fix that, we have to tell ESLint the version of Javascript we want it to support by setting the `parserOption`.

`.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2022
  },
  "env": {
    "browser": true
  }
}
```

Now ESLint should be working as expected.
![Back no normal after fixing parser error](/images/react-development-setup-part2/fix-parser-error.png)

Let's also configure ESLint to support global variables in ES6; these include things like `Promise`.

`.eslintrc.json`

```json
{
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2022
  },
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es6": true
  }
}
```

Like what we did for Prettier, let's add an NPM script for linting our code.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel",
    "build": "parcel build",
    "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.{js,jsx}\"",
    "lint": "eslint --fix \"src/**/*.{js,jsx}\""
  },
```

Now we have a basic setup for our code formatter and linter.

In the next part of the series, I will dive into React specific linter setup and git hook for running Prettier and ESLint automatically before each commit.

Until next time, bye.
